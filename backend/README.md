## ⚙️ Setup & Installation

1. Prerequisites

Node.js
 (LTS recommended)

npm

2. Install dependencies

```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

3. Configure environment

Create a .env file in the backend root:

- SERVER_URL= http://localhost:3001
- EMAIL_USER=your-email@example.com
- EMAIL_PASS=your-email-password-or-app-password

4. Run the backend server

```bash
npm run dev
```
The server will start on http://localhost:3001 (or the port set in .env).

5. Run tests

```bash
npm test
```

## 🔗 Frontend Integration

The frontend communicates with the backend through backendService.ts.
Ensure the backend is running before starting the frontend.

---

## 📌 Notes

Keep your .env file private (already ignored in .gitignore).

Backend is lightweight and can be extended with more routes/services if needed.
